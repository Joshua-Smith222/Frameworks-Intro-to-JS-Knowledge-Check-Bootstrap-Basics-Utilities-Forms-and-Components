# Bootstrap Assignment - Webpage with Responsive Features

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Bootstrap to create a fully responsive webpage. The webpage includes several key components like a navigation bar, registration form, table for displaying user data, responsive images, and buttons, making use of Bootstrap's utilities, forms, tables, and components.

## Features
- **Responsive Navigation Bar**: A collapsible navigation bar that adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Registration Form**: A form with fields for first name, last name, email, and password, along with a terms checkbox. The form uses Bootstrap's grid layout to ensure proper alignment and validation for the email and password fields.
- **User Data Table**: A responsive table to simulate user data. It uses Bootstrap's table component with striped and hoverable rows, and the table is made responsive with the `table-responsive` class.
- **Responsive Images**: A large responsive image stretches across the width of the screen, and a circular image is displayed below.
- **Buttons**: Includes two buttons:
  - One is always visible.
  - The second is hidden on small screens using Bootstrap's responsive utility classes (`d-none` and `d-md-block`).

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**
- **Bootstrap 5**
- **CSS (for additional styling)**

## Project Structure
- **index.html**: Main HTML file containing the webpage structure, including navigation, forms, images, tables, and buttons.
- **style.css** (optional): Custom CSS file (if you add any specific styles).
- **Bootstrap CDN**: Bootstrap is linked via CDN for responsive layout and components.
